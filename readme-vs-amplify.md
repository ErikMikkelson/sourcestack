# sourcestack vs AWS Amplify

I've used AWS Amplify to create a number of applications and it's a great tool. 

However there are a few things about Amplify that don't fit with my personal preferences and technical requirements. At the time of writing, this includes the following:

- Amplify tries to simplify development by hiding a lot of the configuration of underlying infrastructure. This is great for getting started but can lead to problems down the line when your requirements no longer match the framework's assumptions. I prefer to have full visibility, understanding and control of all infrastructure.
- No out of the box support for running API code locally.
- Hard-to-read autogenerated CloudFormation templates.
- API code stored in deeply nested directory structure, e.g. amplify/backend/function/apifunction
- Authentication mechanism stores sensitive data in browser local storage, increasing the risk of XSS attacks. See https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js/issues/3436
- Lack of Typescript support.
